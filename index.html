        <h5>Who Am I?</h5>
        <p>
            My name is Akhil Manasani. I'm currently a first year at the University of Maryland 
            studying computer science. Originally, I'm from South Windsor, Connecticut (a town 
            twenty minutes out from Hartford), but I came to Maryland due to the strength of 
            the computer science program.

        <h5>What are some of your hobbies?</h5>
        <p>
            In my free time, besides programming, I love to run long distance. Back in high 
            school, I ran track and field and cross country, and now, I run recreationally 
            and for fun. I also love to rock climb. You can find me at Eppley rock climbing 
            at their wall about 90% of the time. 
        </p>

        <h5>What are some of your computer science projects?</h5>
        <p>
            I did a research project at the University of Connecticut with Dr. Haim Bar 
            regarding the activity of compounds with noise, and finding the specific activity
            threshold safe for the market. I joined the project a little late, but I was able 
            to pick up the basics early and generate what the group called, birdhead plots.

            I also did a project regarding the validity of the Pythagorean Expectation in the NFL
            for the past, and testing if the equation was still working. I had to make a couple of 
            tweaks via predictive analytics and R. This was one of my very first projects and 
            introduced me into the world of data science.
